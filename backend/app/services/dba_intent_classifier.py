"""Intent classification for AskData (agentic_dba_tasks #1 + #10).

Task #1 shipped the deterministic keyword gate; task #10 restructured it as
a REGISTRY of intent handlers, mirroring autopilot_registry.py's allow-list
pattern: each entry declares an intent name, a deterministic matcher, and a
handler reference (routing hint). Adding a future intent ("propose an index
for a slow query", "add a DQ check to table X") means registering a new
IntentSpec — not touching the classification core.

Classification stays deterministic/pattern-based on purpose (cheap, fast,
auditable, offline-testable). Swapping in an LLM classifier is a separate,
future decision if pattern-matching proves insufficient — not this module's
job.

Word-boundary regexes are used for build verbs in base form on purpose:
r"\bcreate\b" does NOT match "created", so "show me tables created last
week" stays a read query.

# a source table literally named e.g. "critical risks" would still collide;

# governance status?", "are there any compliance issues?" — that the
# original phrase set missed. "data quality" specifically stayed anchored
# to a possessive/question form ("my/our data quality", "how is ... data
# quality") rather than added bare: an earlier attempt at a bare "data
# quality" phrase misfired on "email the data quality report to ops@…"
