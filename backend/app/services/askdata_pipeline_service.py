"""Conversational NL-to-SQL pipeline for AskData Bot (ADB-T1/T2/T3/T5).

Grounds generation in the persisted Schema Intel catalog (falls back to
live schema introspection if the connection hasn't been scanned yet — see
_ground_schema), reuses NL2SQLService for the actual generation logic
(Ollama-or-template — shared with Query Studio's legacy NL2SQL surface,
not duplicated here), then enforces read-only execution via
statement_classifier (also shared with Query Studio: AskData must NEVER
write, unlike Query Studio's gated write path) and masks PII columns for
the viewer role using SecurityService's existing keyword classifier.

Conversation context (ADB-T5) is folded into the question text sent to
NL2SQLService.generate_sql rather than passed as a separate parameter —
that function doesn't have a history parameter, and this is the smallest
way to give the LLM path prior turns without forking it. Known tradeoff:
generate_sql's fast-path template matching (`pattern in question.lower()`)
also sees the history-prefixed text, so if a *prior* turn happened to
contain a fast-path phrase like "show all tables", a fresh question could
misfire down that path. Judged low-risk (those are quite specific idioms a
user wouldn't casually restate) rather than worth forking the shared
generation function.

Summarization is deterministic (row-count / single-value framing), not
another LLM call — keeps this path fast and testable, matching Autopilot's
precedent of avoiding LLM calls where a rule-based answer is sufficient.
